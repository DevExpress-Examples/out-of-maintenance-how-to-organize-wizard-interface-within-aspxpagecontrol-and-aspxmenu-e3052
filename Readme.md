# How to organize Wizard interface within ASPxPageControl and ASPxMenu


<p>The example illustrates how to organize Wizard interface within ASPxPageControl and ASPxMenu. Navigation between Wizard's step is performed via the "Next" button or by clicking the corresponding MenuItem. The client-side validation occurs before each next Wizard's step - all inputs should be populated with the corresponding values. Validation errors are grouped within the ASPxValidationSummary control. The content of each TabPage (Wizard's step) is organized within the corresponding ValidationGroup.</p><p><strong>See Also: <br />
